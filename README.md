# Spotifier
A python program that "converts" a youtube playlist to a spotify playlist. Heavily inspired/copied by TheComeUpCode's SpotifyGeneratePlaylist*

This is my first attempt at messing around with youtube's and spotify's apis. I feel like there are a lot of useful programs that can reduce our time spent in searching the same song twice in two different music apps, but besides wanting to create my own, I didn't find a py. script that when a youtube song/video doesn't exist in spotify, it downloads it and puts in your local playlist

It's still in development, so it doesnt have docs, sorry :(

TheComeUp, if you are reading this, I just want to say thanks for the amazing video and instructions, and if by any means my repo bothers you, i can take it down anytime.
